# Graph-Redactor
A minimalistic program to work with graphs: oriented, weighted, undirected, pseudographs, partially with multigraphs. The program also allows you to build an adjacency matrix.

Management:
Twisting the mouse wheel when hovering over a vertex of the graph is a change in the radius of the vertex.
Twisting the mouse wheel with the Shift held down is zooming.
Moving the mouse with the left key held down is moving around the field.
Left-clicking on a vertex means to "grab" the vertex with the cursor for further movement. Pressing it again will "release" the vertex.
G - Disable the grid.
B - Turn on the mode when the distance to which we move the vertex with the left key is not continuous, but discrete.
Ctrl + S - Save the graph.
Ctrl + O - Open the graph file.
When the erase function is enabled, left-clicking on the field while pressing Shift simultaneously deletes the entire graph on the field.
